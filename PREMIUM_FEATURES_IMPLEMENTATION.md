# HearO Premium Features Implementation

This document outlines the complete implementation of Adapty-powered premium features in the HearO app.

## Overview

The premium features system has been implemented with a clean architecture that separates free and premium functionality while providing seamless upgrade prompts for users.

## Architecture

### Core Services

1. **SubscriptionService** (`Services/SubscriptionService.swift`)
   - Manages Adapty integration and subscription status
   - Handles profile fetching, purchases, and restore functionality
   - Caches subscription status for offline use
   - Provides real-time subscription status updates

2. **FeatureManager** (`Services/FeatureManager.swift`)
   - Implements business logic for all premium feature gates
   - Tracks daily usage limits and ad rewards
   - Handles feature access validation
   - Provides upgrade prompt messages

3. **PaywallView** (`Views/PaywallView.swift`)
   - Beautiful, modern paywall UI built with SwiftUI
   - Shows triggered feature context
   - Integrates with AdaptyUI for subscription options
   - Handles purchase flow and error states

### Dependency Injection

Updated `ServiceContainer` to include:
- `SubscriptionService.shared`
- `FeatureManager.shared`

if !featureCheck.allowed {
    paywallTriggerFeature = .specificFeature
    showPaywall = true
    return
}
// Proceed with premium functionality
```

## Paywall Triggers

The system shows contextual paywall prompts for:
- `unlimitedRecordings` - When daily limit exceeded
- `unlimitedDuration` - When recording time limit reached
- `export` - When trying to export or copy text
- `folderManagement` - When trying to create folders
- `allLanguages` - When selecting restricted languages
- `noAds` - General premium benefits
- `unlimitedHistory` - For history retention benefits

## Configuration

### Adapty Setup
- Proper async configuration in `HearOApp.swift`
- AdaptyUI integration for paywall display
- Error handling and logging

### Feature Limits
All limits are configurable in `FeatureManager.FreeTierLimits`:
- `maxRecordingDuration`: 5 minutes
- `dailyRecordingLimit`: 2 recordings
- `maxBonusRecordings`: 2 additional
- `rewardedAdsPerBonus`: 2 ads per bonus
- `historyRetentionDays`: 7 days
- `allowedLanguages`: ["en", "es", "fr"]

## User Experience

1. **Seamless Integration**: Premium checks are invisible to premium users
2. **Contextual Prompts**: Users see relevant feature benefits when hitting limits
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Free users gradually discover premium features
4. **Clear Value**: Each paywall shows specific benefits of upgrading

## Technical Notes

- All services use `@MainActor` for UI thread safety
- Subscription status is cached for offline scenarios
- Daily limits reset automatically at midnight

## Testing

The implementation supports:
- Mock subscription states for testing
- Premium feature toggling for development
- Paywall flow testing without actual purchases
- Ad reward system testing

## Future Enhancements

2. **A/B Testing**: Test different paywall presentations
3. **Localization**: Multi-language paywall content
4. **Advanced Features**: Additional premium-only features
5. **Subscription Management**: In-app subscription management UI
